## Welcome to Scala

This folder includes installation instructions and lessons to get you started with the Scala programming language.

Here are some other resources that you might also find useful:

[Functional Programming, Simplified](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/fp-book/learning-functional-programming-in-scala) by Alvin Alexander

    As well as giving an introduction to Scala, this book also focuses on explaining some of the reasoning behind the functional approach to programming that we will explore this semester. The first 45 lessons are available free online.

[Programming in Scala](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/705a/Scala/Programming-in-Scala.pdf) by Martin Odersky, et al.

    Written by one of the lead designers of the language, this book is the go-to source for all the ins and outs of the Scala language. The first version of the book is available free online (and is only out of date in a few minor places).
    
[Scala API Documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/)

    Look here for documentation of the Scala language including the built-in structures that are available for use and the operations that the language provides for manipulating them.
