### Course Description

This course will introduce students to a set of general techniques for building formal models based in mathematics and computation. We will develop a compositional approach to model-building, based on a small number of modeling primitives which can assembled in many different ways to address many different questions. 

The first half of the course will cover process representations, using them to explore the mantra: *A model is a mapping*. In particular, any model involves three parts which together define some sort of calculation:
+ An abstract process representations expressed in terms of information and resource flows. This provides the plan for a calculation.
+ A mathematical formalism such as probability or differential equations. This tells us how to perform the steps of the calculation.
+ An assignment of abstract process elements (e.g., subprocesses) to mathematical entities (e.g., probabilities or differential equations). This tells us the actual values to use when evaluating the calculation.

The second half of the class will cover class-based and ontological approaches to system description. These use logical and graph-based representations to package, organize and validate system data. More importantly, we will discuss methods for integrating overlapping models, which allows us to build complex system-level models by putting together simpler pieces.

The course will be project-driven. Each student will select a project or domain of interest and, throughout the course, develop a portfolio of formal models relevant to that area. In the first half of the course you will work independently to develop models for your chosen domain. In the second half you will be teamed with other students in the class and expected to integrate your models to address more complex systems-level questions.

The approach that we follow in this course is based on a branch of mathematics called category theory, an abstract approach to the study of compositional systems. For completeness we will also cover several other formal and semi-formal modeling techniques including industry-standard UML/SysML, formal ontology language OWL and database language SQL.

### Grading

Your grade will be computed as a weighted average with the following weights:

| **Assignment** | **Value** |**Assignment** | **Value** |
|---|---|---|---|
| HW0 | 4% | Solo Presentation | 8% |
| HW1 | 12% | Group Presentation | 12% |
| HW2 | 12% | Group Report | 25% |
| HW3 | 12% | Participation | 5% |
| Quizzes | 10% | | |
The translation between numeric and letter grades is:

| | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | 93-100+ |  **B+** | 87-89.9 | **C+** | 74-76.9 |
| **A-** | 90-92.9 | **B** | 80-86.9 | **C** | 64-73.9 |
| **F** | < 60 | **B-** | 77-79.9 | **C-** | 60-63.9 |

#### Attendance

#### Late Work

Assignments are due **before** 3:30 PM (class time) on the date listed in the course schedule above. All assignments should be submitted via email to both Spencer and Sub (addresses listed above).

Late submissions will be penalized as follows:

+ 0-24 hours late (including during class): 90% credit
+ 24-72 hours: 70% credit
+ Any assignment more than three days late will be dealt with on an individual basis and **may not be accepted**.

#### Course Learning Outcomes
On completion of the course, students will be able to: 
+ Model a system processes at 2-3 levels of abstraction, and formally document the relationships between these models.
+ Convert a process representation into a behavioral model in a formal domain such as  probability, dynamical systems or computer science.
+ Build a domain-specific language (semantic model) to represent background knowledge and requirements for some aspect of a system process. 
+ Build formal mappings (bridges) between multiple models, and use these to analyze a systems-level question which depends on multiple domains or sub-systems.

#### Instructor’s Mission Statement
+ To provide students with tools and methods for developing formal models of system organization and behavior, and to illustrate these through diverse examples.
+ To engage each student in a concrete application of these methods based on their own expertise and interest.
+ To enhance and evaluate a student’s academic independence and critical thinking.
+ To regularly solicit feedback to improve the quality of lectures and course materials.
