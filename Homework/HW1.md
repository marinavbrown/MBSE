## Homework 1

In problems 3 & 4 you are asked to construct a collection of string diagrams. You may use whatever program you like to create your diagrams (or draw them by hand, but you may need to edit/redraw them in the future). I recommend [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). However, **please submit your diagrams as a single PDF file for grading**. 


1. Use a Gantt chart or a PERT diagram to plan out the work for your project this semester. Include personal tasks and checkpoints as well as due dates and assignments. Be sure to work with your partner to develop a schedule for integrating your models in the second half of the semester.

1. Figure 3 in the [Wang reading](http://bluehawk.monmouth.edu/~jwang/Petri%20Nets%20--%20Introduction.pdf) presents 6 small Petri nets representing different types of interactions. For each of the first five (a-e) give a real-world example in which the net applies, and explain the dynamics of the Petri net in reference to your example.

2. Use string diagrams to reformulate  the [2017 IRS 1040EZ form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f1040ez--2017.pdf) (lines 1-14 including worksheet). You may assume that the form applies and ignore the section **Use this form if**.

   As discussed in class, use layers of abstraction to simplify your models. Try to include as much information from the form as you can (e.g., W2 & 1099 from line 7) but do not use any other forms (e.g., do not consult outside instructions).
   
3. In this problem you will model *two* complex processes from the domain(s) of interest that you listed for your course project.

   - Use string diagrams to describe each mapping at multiple levels of abstraction. 
    
    - Identify any important requirements or assumptions about the processes you have described. These might include desired output states, required input states or specific input-output relationships to name a few.
    - Try to explain (using elements of your model) why the low-level properties you have set ensure the overall (high-level) process meets its requirements.
    - What questions would you like to ask about these processes this semester? What information and techniques might be needed to answer these questions?
